        "What is RAG?\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It's a technique that combines large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge sources to improve the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated text.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How Does RAG Work? Unveiling the Power of External Knowledge\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we start the core RAG process, we need to provide a foundation as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Building the Knowledge Base:** The system starts by transforming documents and information within the external knowledge base (like Wikipedia or a company database) into a special format called **vector representations**. These condense the meaning of each document into a series of **numbers**, capturing the essence of the content.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Vector Database for Speedy Retrieval**: These vector representations are then stored in a specialized database called a vector database. This database is optimized for efficiently **searching and retrieving** information based on **semantic similarity**. Imagine it as a super-powered library catalog that **understands the meaning** of documents, **not just keywords**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, let's explore how RAG leverages this foundation:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **User Input**: The RAG process begins with a question or **prompt** from the user. This could be anything from \"What caused the extinction of the dinosaurs?\" to a more open-ended request like \"Write a creative story.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Intelligent Retrieval**: RAG doesn't rely solely on the **LLM's internal knowledge**. It employs an information retrieval component that acts like a super-powered search engine. This component scans the vast external knowledge base – like a company's internal database for specific domains – to find information **directly relevant** to the user's input. Unlike a traditional **search engine** that relies on **keywords**, RAG leverages the power of vector representations to understand the **semantic meaning** of the user's prompt and identify the most relevant documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Enriched Context Creation**: The retrieved information isn't just shown alongside the prompt. RAG cleverly **merges the user input with the relevant snippets** from the knowledge base. This creates a ***richer context*** for the LLM to understand the **user's intent** and formulate a well-informed response.\n",
        "\n",
        "* **LLM Powered Response Generation**: Finally, the **enriched context** is fed to the Large Language Model (LLM). The LLM, along with its ability to process language patterns, now has a strong **foundation of factual** information to draw upon. This empowers it to generate a response that is both comprehensive and accurate, addressing the specific needs of the user's prompt.\n",

        "This code is designed to tokenize the text chunks produced by the previous code using the `SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter`. Let's break down the code and its purpose:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `token_splitter = SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter(chunk_overlap=0, model_name=\"distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1\", tokens_per_chunk=128)`: This line initializes a tokenizer object named `token_splitter`. It utilizes the `SentenceTransformersTokenTextSplitter` class, which tokenizes text into chunks based on a specified model. The parameters provided are:\n",
        "   - `chunk_overlap=0`: This parameter specifies that there should be no overlap between tokenized chunks.\n",
        "   - `model_name=\"distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1\"`: This parameter specifies the name of the pre-trained model to be used for tokenization. In this case, it's using the \"distiluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1\" model.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - `tokens_per_chunk=128`: This parameter determines the maximum number of tokens allowed per chunk after tokenization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `token_split_texts = []`: This line initializes an empty list to store the tokenized text chunks.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `for text in character_split_texts:`: This line starts a loop iterating over the text chunks produced by the character splitter.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `token_split_texts += token_splitter.split_text(text)`: Within the loop, this line tokenizes each text chunk using the `token_splitter` object and adds the resulting tokenized chunks to the `token_split_texts` list.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. `print(token_split_texts[10])`: This line prints out the 11th tokenized chunk for inspection.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. `print(f\"\\nTotal chunks: {len(token_split_texts)}\")`: This line prints out the total number of tokenized chunks produced.\n",
        "\n",
        "The reason for applying this code after the character splitting code is likely to further process the text data. Character splitting breaks down the text into smaller, more manageable chunks, and tokenization further breaks down those chunks into individual tokens, often for tasks like natural language processing (NLP) or machine learning. By applying both character splitting and tokenization, the text data becomes more structured and suitable for various NLP tasks.\n",
